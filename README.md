# Also OpenSea NFT

I call this repo Generative Art but I wanted to show that we can make simple NFT by Googling and easy ideas

The thing is that we don't know the licences about using color palettes so as I use a Share Alike licence in general I just say that it comes from that or that site

## My OFFICIAL exposition galleries

I have anonymous accounts for NFT but this list is with the official one
